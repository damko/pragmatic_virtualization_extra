# Packer templates for Pragramatic Virtualization

This directory contains the required scripts for Packer to build a Debian based box starting from a net-install iso. The box will be compatible with Virtualbox and Vagrant.

This scripts come from this [repository](https://github.com/damko/packer-templates) which is an rearranged version of the [Tech Angels original repository](https://github.com/tech-angels/packer-templates)
